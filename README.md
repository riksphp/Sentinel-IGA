# Sentinel-IGA
Sentinel IGA is a multi-agent orchestrator that secures the AI-driven SDLC. Using LangGraph and MCP, it moves beyond linting to enforce Identity Governance. By indexing repos into a "Knowledge Brain," it detects "Entitlement Creep" and SoD violations in real-time, providing a binary merge verdict. It’s the gatekeeper for the AI factory.
